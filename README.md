###I would like to explain what I learned at MITT

##HTML coding
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. Mainly, we use it to structure a website.
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>   //document type
<head>    //HTML head will include some information for browsers
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="tes.css">
</head>
<body>    //everything will be written in the body and shown to users.
    <header>    //useing HTML tags to structure everything.
        <div>
        </div>
    </header>
</body>
```
